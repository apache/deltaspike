 * those instances! The scope of the implementations will also be ignored as they will not get picked up as CDI
 * beans.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Please note that the configuration will only be available after the boot is finished. This means that you cannot use
 * this configuration inside a CDI Extension before the boot is finished!</p>
