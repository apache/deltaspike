/**
 * Marker interface for all classes used for configuration of DeltaSpike itself.

 * <p>
 * All DeltaSpike configuration objects implement this interface so they can be found more easily. There is no other

 *
 * <p>
 * DeltaSpike uses a <i>type-safe configuration</i> approach. Instead of writing a properties file or XML, you just
 * implement one of the configuration interfaces which will then be picked up as a CDI bean. If there is already a
 * default configuration for some functionality in DeltaSpike, you can use &#064;Specializes or &#064;Alternative to
 * change those.</p>
