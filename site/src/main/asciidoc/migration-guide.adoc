== Introduction



== Apache MyFaces CODI to Apache DeltaSpike

=== Example Overview


* http://s.apache.org/xA[Fullstack CODI to DeltaSpike @ os890]


=== Basically unchanged parts


Here you can see features which were added and the concept itself didn't change (only the packages, config keys,...)

==== Project-stage


Only the config key changed (TODO)


==== Deactivatable and ClassDeactivator


The concept hasn't changed.


==== CodiConfig


The concept hasn't changed.


==== Annotation literals


The concept hasn't changed. We just added further implementations.


==== BeanManagerProvider


The concept hasn't changed. We just splitted the functionality. The util
methods are available in BeanProvider and their name and signature have
been unified.


=== Extended concepts


Here you can see features which were added and the concept itself
changed a bit or got merged with concepts from Seam3


==== ConfiguredValueResolver


Here we added more flexibility (esp. re-ordering the default lookup
mechanisms). See `ConfigResolver`, `ConfigSourceProvider` and
`ConfigSource`.


==== ProjectStageActivated and ExpressionActivated


We merged them with a feature of Seam3 and now it's called `@Exclude`.
That means the basic functionality is still in place (nothing was
removed), but the logic is now inverse.


==== DefaultAnnotation


(In progress) We merge it with a similar helper of Seam-Solder to
provide custom values for annotation attributes.


=== Postponed concepts

We couldn't agree on these features. If you find them useful, please
contact the mailing-list. If we see that users need it for reasons we
might haven't seen so far, we will discuss it again.


==== BeanNames



=== Dropped concepts



==== Java 1.5 Support



=== JSF Module


==== Type-safe view config


* Changed names
* Annotations are optional
