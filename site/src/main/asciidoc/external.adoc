A number of DeltaSpike examples and templates have been developed external to the DeltaSpike project. These extend the DeltaSpike resources from which you can see DeltaSpike in action. Brief information is given here about the examples and templates, with details of where they can be obtained from.

== Presentations

=== Apache DeltaSpike: The CDI toolbox
CDI portable extensions are one of greatest features of Java EE allowing the platform to be extended in a clean and portable way. But allowing extension is just part of the story. CDI opens the door to a whole new eco-system for Java EE, but it’s not the role of the specification to create these extensions. 
Apache DeltaSpike is the project that leads this brand new eco-system by providing useful extension modules for CDI applications as well as tools to ease the creation of new ones.
In this session, we’ll start by presenting the DeltaSpike toolbox and show how it helps you to develop for CDI. Then we’ll describe the major extensions included in Deltaspike, including  'configuration', 'scheduling' and 'data'.

=== DeltaSpike: CDI extensions of the world, unite!
Several popular CDI extension frameworks like Seam 3 and MyFaces CODI have faded out over the years. But not to worry - their functionality is taken over by projects like Picketlink, Agorava, and mainly DeltaSpike, a new Apache project that wants CDI extension authors to unite in an effort to make the life of web application developers easier. Even without a five year plan!

=== MyFaces CODI and JBoss Seam3 become Apache DeltaSpike
These slides show how to use type-safe mechanisms provided by MyFaces CODI for developing JSF applications which are more type-safe and easier to maintain as well as common pitfalls. Beyond that there is an basic overview of Apache DeltaSpike.

=== Migrating a JSF-Based Web Application from Spring 3 to Java EE 7 and CDI
This talk is a detailed case study about the migration of a JSF-based web application from Spring 3 to Java EE 7 and CDI. It is presented at the JavaOne 2014 conference.

== Examples

=== Confess 2012 Workshop Demo
This example was prepared for the Confess workshop and demonstrates how to use DeltaSpike instead of and side-by-side with MyFaces CODI. The secured web application demonstrates presenting users with differentiating content based on their account status.

=== Fullstack EE6+ with DeltaSpike
Simple example based on Java EE6+ and DeltaSpike (tested with EE6 and EE7).

**Source code:** https://github.com/os890/ee6-ds-demo

=== Fullstack CODI to DeltaSpike
This pair of examples show how to achieve the most important MyFaces CODI features with DeltaSpike and also how to migrate a CODI project to DeltaSpike. The examples are basic, compacting core CODI features into just a few JSF pages, and are intended for deployment with TomEE. 

**Source code:** https://github.com/os890/tomee_mf_stack_001

* CODI version in master branch
* Migrated DeltaSpike version in codi2ds branch

=== JBoss Quickstarts 
The JBoss quickstarts are small working examples that demonstrate recommended practices for specific Java EE technology use cases. A subset of these quickstarts are dedicated to demonstrating DeltaSpike, including custom authorization restrictions using annotations, constructing and modifying beans, extending the influence of CDI using BeanManager, and deactivating DeltaSpike features.
