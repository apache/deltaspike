=== Proposal (30.11.2011)


After some discussions between the teams (of Apache MyFaces CODI, Seam3 and CDISource), Mark Struberg submitted the
http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/DeltaSpikeProposal[proposal]. Since Spike couldn't be used as project-name, we agreed on DeltaSpike as initial code name (delta because it closes several gaps).
