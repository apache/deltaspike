link:documentation/overview.html[View details »]| DeltaSpike consists of a number of portable CDI extensions that provide
useful features for Java application developers.

We will also ensure true portability! We are testing DeltaSpike on
different CDI implementations like Apache OpenWebBeans and JBoss Weld,
and also on different Java EE servers like Apache Tomcat and TomEE,
JBoss AS7, WildFly 8.x and 9.x, Oracle GlassFish 3.1+ and 4.x+, IBM
WebSphere 8.x, Oracle WebLogic Server 12c, Jetty, and others.
