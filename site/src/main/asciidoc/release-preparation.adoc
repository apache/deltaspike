== Introduction


Once a Release has been staged on http://repository.apache.org it must
be reviewed by each PMC member *before* casting his VOTE.

The following points need to be checked:

* is the GPG signature fine?
* is there a source archive?
* can the source archive really be built?
* is there a correct LICENSE and NOTICE file in each artifact (both
source and binary artifacts)?
* does the NOTICE file contain all necessary attributions?
* check the dependencies. We must not have any GPL dependencies and LGPL
only if they are optional, etc! See
http://www.apache.org/legal/3party.html
* do all the tests work?
* if there is a TCK to run, does it succeed?
* if there is a tag in the SCM, does it contain reproduceable sources?
