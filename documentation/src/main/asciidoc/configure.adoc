DeltaSpike is available for use in Maven-based and Maven-independent projects. Instructions are given here for obtaining released final versions of DeltaSpike for both approaches.

NOTE: You can also opt to use the lastest DeltaSpike snapshots; for more information, see <<snapshots#,Use DeltaSpike Snapshots>>.

== Option A: Configure DeltaSpike in Maven-based Projects
DeltaSpike released versions are available from the Maven Central repository for use in Maven-based projects. This means that you do not need to modify your Maven configuration `settings.xml` file; when building projects, Maven automatically searches the online Maven Central repository for project dependencies and downloads sources to your local Maven repository. 

To begin use the DeltaSpike releases from Maven Central, you simply need to configure the project `pom.xml` file for each project with information about the release version and modules you want to use. At a minimum, you must add the DeltaSpike Core module, which provides the DeltaSpike API and utility classes.

. Open the project `pom.xml` file for editing
. Add the DeltaSpike version to the list of properties
+
[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<properties>
    <deltaspike.version>{latestStable}</deltaspike.version>
</properties>
----
+
. Add the DeltaSpike Core module to the list of dependencies
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.deltaspike.core</groupId>
    <artifactId>deltaspike-core-api</artifactId>
    <version>${deltaspike.version}</version>
    <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.deltaspike.core</groupId>
    <artifactId>deltaspike-core-impl</artifactId>
    <version>${deltaspike.version}</version>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
----
+
. Save the `pom.xml` file changes

TIP: The API is scoped for compile time and implementation only included for runtime, assisting to prevent you from inadvertantly depending on an implementation class.

== Option B: Configure DeltaSpike in Maven-independent Projects
Deltaspike is provided as a set of downloadable .jar files for projects not utilizing the Maven build system. Alternatively, you can build the DeltaSpike .jar files from source; for instructions, see <<build#,Build DeltaSpike from Source>>. In both cases, you must add the DeltaSpike .jar files directly to your projects. 

To use DeltaSpike without Maven from the downloadable .jar files, complete the following steps:

. Download the latest `distribution-full-<version>.zip` from https://deltaspike.apache.org/download.html
. Extract the archive contents
+
[source,shell]
----
$ unzip distribution-full-<version>.zip
----
+
. Add the source to your project
a. For .war projects, copy the .jar files to the `WEB-INF/lib` directory
b. For .ear projects, copy the .jar files to the `EAR/lib directory` and add the following to `META-INF/application.xml`:
+
[source,xml]
----
<library-directory>lib</library-directory>
----
