== Configuration Basics


The goal of the DeltaSpike configuration mechanism is to make it
obsolete to touch released binaries for changing the configuration of
your project. All values which are needed in your code (but should not
be hardcoded as static final constants) can be maintained via
DeltaSpikes own configuration mechanism in a very flexible and powerful
way.


=== Benefits for Production


Once a binary like a WAR file or an EAR got created and tested, it must
_not_ get changed anymore. The exact same binary which got created by
the release manager will get moved to the Test system, then further
propagated to the Staging environment and finally (if all people are
happy with it) will get moved to the Production system. And all this
without any changes on the binary itself!

The Apache DeltaSpike configuration system makes this possible by
providing a default configuration inside the binary and allowing to
amend this configuration (e.g. database credentials, some URLs from
remote REST or SOAP endpoints, etc) from outside like environment
settings, JNDI or the current <<projectstage.adoc#,ProjectStage>>.


=== Drop-In Configuration

This mechanism also allows for dynamic configuration in case of a JAR
drop-in. By adding some JAR to the classpath, all its contained
configuration will get picked up and considered in the property value
evaluation. You could also use this mechanism to switch implementations
of some SPI (Service Provider Interface) in your own code.

=== CDI-Extension Configuration

In some cases low-level configs are needed, for example during the bootstrapping
process of the CDI container.

The good news: our DeltaSpike configuration mechanism does not rely on
any other EE mechanism to be booted. Which means it can perfectly get
used to even configure those parts itself. Since the mechanism does not
rely on CDI it can for example be used to configure CDI-Extensions.

Currently this is, for example, used to configure the value of the current <<projectstage.adoc#,ProjectStage>>, configured values which can be
used in the expressions for `@Exclude`, 'Deactivatable', etc. DeltaSpike
needs such a low-level approach for several features internally, but
users can utilize it for their own needs as well. This is done by using
the `ConfigResolver` which resolves and caches `ConfigSource`s per
application.

=== Userland Configuration

DeltaSpike also provides a mechanism to inject those configured values
using the `@ConfigProperty` CDI Qualifier.


== ConfigResolver


The `ConfigResolver` is the central point to pick up configured values
in DeltaSpike.

=== getPropertyValue()

The method `ConfigResolver#getPropertyValue(String key)` allows to
provide a string based key and returns the configured value as `String`,
or `null` if no value has been found.

`ConfigResolver#getAllPropertyValues(String key)` has a similar contract
but it returns a list which might be empty if there are no configured
values for the given key.

This is a code excerpt about how to do a simple lookup in the deltaspike
configuration:

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
String dbUserName = ConfigResolver.getPropertyValue("databaseconfig.username");
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


=== getProjectStageAwarePropertyValue()

The method
`ConfigResolver#getProjectStageAwarePropertyValue(String key)` utilizes
the <<projectstage.adoc#,DeltaSpike ProjectStage>> mechanism to allow
configured values to depend on the current `ProjectStage` of the system
we run on.

This is done by first looking up the ProjectStage (this internally
happens with the DeltaSpike ConfigResolver as well) and then go down the
following lookup chain until we found a configured value.

* key + '.' + projectStage , e.g. "databaseconfig.username.Production"
* key alone , e.g. "databaseconfig.username"

=== getPropertyAwarePropertyValue()

The method
`ConfigResolver#getProjectStageAwarePropertyValue(String key, String property)`
first looks up the configured value of the given property and uses this
value to determine the final lookup path. All those lookups take the
<<projectstage.adoc#,DeltaSpike ProjectStage>> mechanism into account.

Given we have the following code in our program:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
String dbUserName = ConfigResolver.getPropertyAwarePropertyValue("databaseconfig.username", "dbvendor");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This will end up in the following lookup sequences. First we need to
resolve the value of the property:

* propertyValue = property + '.' + projectStage, e.g. "dbvendor.Production"
* if nothing found: propertyValue = property, e.g. "dbvendor"

Let's assume we found the value 'mysql' for our dbvendor. In this case
the following lookup chain is used until a value got found:

* key + '.' + property + projectstage, e.g. "databaseconfig.username.mysql.Production"
* key + '.' + property, e.g. "databaseconfig.username.mysql"
* key + '.' + projectstage, e.g. "databaseconfig.username.Production"
* key, e.g. "databaseconfig.username"


=== Handling of Default Values

There is a 2nd variant of all those methods where it is possible to
provide a default value which gets returned instead of `null` or if the
final result is an empty String.

.Performance Hint
TIP: The only `ConfigResolver` operation which is cached is the determination
of the `ConfigSources`. The various getPropertyValue operations are not
cached in the ConfigResolver but might be cached in the ConfigSources.
This makes the overall calculation a bit slower, but allows for values
to change dynamically if someone likes to for example implement a
`JmxConfigSource` (not yet part of DeltaSpike, but easily
implementable).


== ConfigSource

A `ConfigSource` is exactly what its name says: a source for configured
values. The `ConfigResolver` uses all configured implementations of
`ConfigSource` to lookup the property in question.

Each 'ConfigSource' has a specified 'ordinal' which can be configured
using the key `deltaspike_ordinal`. This ordinal get's used to determine
the importance of the values taken from the very ConfigSource. A higher
ordinal means that the values taken from this ConfigSource will override
values from less important ConfigSources. This is the trick which allows
to amend configuration from outside a binary - given those outside
ConfigSources have a higher `deltaspike_ordinal` than the ones who
pickup the values from within the release binaries.

=== ConfigSources Provided by Default


By default there are implementations for the following configuration sources
(listed in the lookup order):

* System properties (deltaspike_ordinal = 400)
* Environment properties (deltaspike_ordinal = 300)
* JNDI values (deltaspike_ordinal = 200, the base name is "java:comp/env/deltaspike/")
* Properties file values (apache-deltaspike.properties) (deltaspike_ordinal = 100, default filename is "META-INF/apache-deltaspike.properties")

*It is possible to change this order and to add custom configuration sources.*

.Important Tips Especially for Custom Implementations
TIP: - The config-source with the highest ordinal gets used first. - If a custom
implementation should be invoked _before_ the default implementations,
use an ordinal-value > 400. - If a custom implementation should be
invoked _after_ the default implementations, use an ordinal-value < 100.
- The `ConfigResolver` performs no caching. If your custom ConfigSource
operation is expensive, then you might think about introducing some
caching.

=== Reordering of the Default Order of ConfigSources

To change the lookup order, you have to configure the ordinal in the
corresponding configuration source (e.g. to change the configuration ordinal of the
configuration source for system properties, you have to set the system property
with the ordinal key 'deltaspike_ordinal' and the new value).

Example with `/META-INF/apache-deltaspike.properties`: If the properties
file/s should be used *before* the other implementations, you have to
configure an ordinal > 400. That means, you have to add for example
`deltaspike_ordinal=401`.

Each single property file is treated as own `ConfigSource` and thus can
have different `deltaspike_ordinal` values!

NOTE: In case of *property files* which are supported by default
(`/META-INF/apache-deltaspike.properties`) every file is handled as
independent config-source, but all of them have ordinal 400 by default
(and can be reordered in a fine-grained manner).

=== Custom ConfigSources

ConfigSources are picked up using the `java.util.ServiceLoader'
mechanism.

To add a custom config-source, you have to implement the interface
`ConfigSource` and register your implementation in a file
`/META-INF/services/org.apache.deltaspike.core.spi.config.ConfigSource`
by writing the fully qualified class name of the custom implementation/s
into it.

If you need dynamic ConfigSources you can also register a
`ConfigSourceProvider` in a similar way. This is useful if you like to
dynamically pick up multiple ConfigSources of the same kind. For example, if you
like to pick up all `myproject.properties` files from all the JARs in
your classpath.

Please note that a single `ConfigSource` should be either registered
directly or via a `ConfigSourceProvider`, but never both ways.

TIP: Have a look at the abstract base-implementation of `ConfigSource`
DeltaSpike is using internally, if a custom implementation should load
the ordinal value from the config-source like the default
implementations provided by DeltaSpike do.

==== PropertyFileConfig

For registering all your own property files of a certain name in your
classpath to get picked up as `ConfigSource`s you can also provide a
class which implements the `PropertyFileConfig` interface.

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
public class MyCustomPropertyFileConfig implements PropertyFileConfig
{
    @Override
    public String getPropertyFileName()
    {
        return "myconfig.properties";
    }
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------

_Note: If you are using WildFly with EAR packaging and with
ear-subdeployments-isolated=true, then your EAR should have a deployment
dependency to the module that contains the property file._

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<jboss-deployment-structure>
    <ear-subdeployments-isolated>true</ear-subdeployments-isolated>
      <deployment>
            <dependencies>
            <!-- This module contains the custom PropertyFileConfig and the property file -->
                  <module name="deployment.yourproject.ear.yoursubmodule.jar"  meta-inf="import" />
            </dependencies>
     </deployment>
</jboss-deployment-structure>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Type-safe Configuration

DeltaSpike provides a way to directly inject configured values into your
code via the qualifier `@ConfigProperty`.

------------------------------------------------------
@ApplicationScoped
public class SomeRandomService
{
    @Inject
    @ConfigProperty(name = "endpoint.poll.interval")
    private Integer pollInterval;

    @Inject
    @ConfigProperty(name = "endpoint.poll.servername")
    private String pollUrl;

    ...
 }
------------------------------------------------------
