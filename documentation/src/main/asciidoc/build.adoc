The DeltaSpike source (modules and examples) is provided for inspection, contribution and testing purposes. The source must be built with Maven, which has been used to automate the compilation, testing and packaging processes. Arquillian tests are automatically conducted when DeltaSpike is built and CDI implementations or containers with which to carry out the tests can be specified.

In all cases, to obtain the DeltaSpike source, link:https://deltaspike.apache.org/download.html[download `deltaspike-project-<version>-source-release.zip`] and extract the contents.
	
**Note:** You can also obtain the DeltaSpike source from the project Git repository. The repository is subject to change and it can be used for contributing but should not be used in production environments. For more information, see <<source#,Get Source and compile it>>.
