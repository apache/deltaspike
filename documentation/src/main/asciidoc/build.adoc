The DeltaSpike source (modules and examples) is provided for inspection, contribution and testing purposes. The source must be built with Maven, which has been used to automate the compilation, testing and packaging processes. Arquillian tests are included with the source and a CDI implementation or container can be specified with which to carry out the tests.

In all cases, to obtain the DeltaSpike source, link:https://deltaspike.apache.org/download.html[download] `deltaspike-project-{latestStable}-source-release.zip` and extract the contents.
	
NOTE: You can also obtain the DeltaSpike source from the project Git repository. The repository is subject to change and it can be used for contributing but should not be used in production environments. For more information, see <<source#,Contribute to the DeltaSpike Source>>.
