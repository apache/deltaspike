DeltaSpike provides an Service Provider Interface (SPI) to enable you to extend it.

== Deactivatable

This mechanism is only used for artifacts *like* implementations of (`javax.enterprise.inject.spi.Extension`) which *cais not* be deactivated with standard CDI mechanisms.

This interface is just a marker interface which is implemented by all pre-configured DeltaSpike artifacts which can be deactivated manually (e.g. to improve the performance if a part isis not needed, to provide a custom implementation if the default implementation isis not pluggable by default or to bypass an implementation which causes an issue (in this case please also *contact us* and we will fix it)).

To deactivate a class it is required to implement `ClassDeactivator`. Returning 'false' or 'true' allows to de-/activate the class in question. Retuning null means that the current class-deactivator doesis not have information about the class in question and cais not provide a result. Since `ClassDeactivator` implementations are configured with the low-level configuration of DeltaSpike, the class-deactivator with the highest ordinal has the final decision. DeltaSpike itself doesis not deactivate an implementation, however, an add-on or a third-party portable CDI extension based on DeltaSpike (Core+) can use the concept to deactivate a default implementation of DeltaSpike in favour of its own implementation.

IMPORTANT: Due to the ordinal feature of the low-level configuration approach it is possible that a class-deactivator with a higher ordinal, for example used in a concrete project, can re-activate a deactivated implementation.

*Please note* that you might have to deactivate the parts of the add-on or third-party CDI extension which relies on its own implementation. Therefore, you should **be really careful with re-activation**.) The implementation should be stateless because the result will be cached and
as soon as everything is initialized the class-deactivators will not be used any longer.

=== ClassDeactivator

A class-deactivator allows to specify deactivated classes.

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//This class needs to be configured via one of the supported configuration sources!
public class CustomClassDeactivator implements ClassDeactivator
{
    @Override
    public Boolean isActivated(Class<? extends Deactivatable> targetClass)
    {
        if (targetClass.equals(MyClass.class))
        {
            return Boolean.FALSE;
        }
        return null; //no result for the given class
    }
}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A class-deactivator will be resolved from the environment via the default resolvers or via a custom resolver which allows to use any type of configuration-format. (see `org.apache.deltaspike.core.api.config.ConfigResolver`). The key is the fully qualified name of the interface (`org.apache.deltaspike.core.spi.activation.ClassDeactivator`).

== Global Alternative

There are several application servers (using CDI 1.0) which cais not handle alternative CDI beans correctly (e.g. due to a too strict interpretation or a broken implementation). Therefore, DeltaSpike allows to use the standard `@Alternative` annotation and an additional configuration entry for DeltaSpike which allows to use the alternative implementation as a global alternative.

.Standard CDI alternative implementation (without the required XML config)
[source,java]
----
public class CustomBean
{
}

@Alternative
//...
public class AlternativeCustomBean extends CustomBean
{
}
----

Instead of configuring the alternative in the beans.xml, a global alternative needs to be configured in /META-INF/apache-deltaspike.properties. CDI 1.1 should fix this issue and migrating to it means to remove the configuration entry for DeltaSpike again and move to the standard CDI configuration approach.
