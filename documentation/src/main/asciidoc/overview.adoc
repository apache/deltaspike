== Background

=== CDI
Java Contexts and Dependency Injection for the Java EE platform (link:https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=299[JSR 299]), abbreviated to CDI, was introduced as part of Java EE6. The core features of CDI are as follows:

* improved stateful object lifecycles with an additional context named _Conversation_ that encompasses a series of requests within one session and lifecycle management by the container according to well-defined contexts
* dependency injection conducted in a type-safe manner, with type checking conducted at compilation time so errors are exposed earlier and debugging is easier
* event notification facility for object interaction
* a better approach for interceptors with annotations binding interceptors to objects and with a new interceptor named _decorator_ that knows about individual bean attributes through inheritence and is more appropriate for use in solving business problems
* a Service Provider Interface (SPI) for developing portable extensions to the CDI container

CDI is a link:https://jcp.org/en/home/index[Java Community Process (JCP)] standard. All Java EE6 compliant application servers must provide support for CDI. link:http://weld.cdi-spec.org/[JBoss Weld] is a reference implementation of the CDI specification and other spec-compliant implementations exist such as link:http://openwebbeans.apache.org/[Apache OpenWebBeans (OWB)]. While CDI is a Java EE6 essential, CDI can also be used in Java SE environments with the aid of standalone CDI implementations.

=== Portable CDI Extensions
The CDI Service Provider Interface (SPI) is exposed to enable extension of the CDI feature set by third-parties. Portable CDI extensions extend CDI implementations and improve existing Java EE APIs by enabling integration of different technologies. 

As set out in the CDI specification, a portable CDI extenstion may integrate with a CDI container as follows:
 
* providing its own beans, interceptors and decorators to the container
* injecting dependencies into its own objects using the dependency injection service
* providing a context implementation for a custom scope
* augmenting or overriding the annotation-based metadata with metadata from some other source

As indicated by the name, _portable_ CDI extensions can be used with any spec-compliant CDI implementation.

== About Apache DeltaSpike
Apache DeltaSpike is a collection of portable CDI extensions. These ready-to-use modules enable you to integrate tested API extensions into your Java projects.

DeltaSpike consists of a core module and a number of optional modules for providing additional enterprise functionality to your applications. The modules include features for enhanced security with type-safe control over method invocations, integration with schedulers, injection of CDI objects into validators, and a transactional context and scope. DeltaSpike also provides boot and shutdown control over CDI containers in Java SE applications.

As a CDI extension, DeltaSpike must be used in conjunction with a CDI implementation and supports both JBoss Weld and Apache OpenWebBeans. DeltaSpike has been tested on a range of application servers and containers that utilize these CDI implementations, such as Apache TomEE, JBoss AS, WildFly, Oracle GlassFish, and Jetty.

In addition to the portable CDI extension modules, DeltaSpike provides a number of examples to show you how to use and get the most from this technology.

== Features of DeltaSpike

=== Java EE 7 without Java EE 7!

*Transactional support for non-EJB beans:* The Transactional Interceptor in DeltaSpike paved the way for @Transactional in Java EE 7.

*Injectable Servlet objects:* Allows the developer to inject CDI beans on Servlets on Java EE 6/CDI 1.0 environments

*Injectable resources:* Configuration, resource bundles,... are easy to inject when using CDI and Apache DeltaSpike.

*@Exclude annotation:* it is possible to annotate beans which should be ignored by CDI even if they are in a CDI enabled archive on Java EE 6/CDI 1.0 environment where you cais not use @Vetoed or a veto based on ProjectStages or expressions is needed.

**Scheduling tasks**: Async processes in a non Java EE 7 environment.

*Bean Validation integration:* Allows to inject CDI beans and EJB in to Constraint-Validators.

*BeanProvider:* Access the BeanManager and CDI beans even in non managed classes like JPA-2.0 EntityListeners or Spring Beans.


=== JSF Improvements

*Multi-window handling:* Allows to manage logical windows for batches,... or in case of JSF it offers proper separation of browser-tabs.

*Type-safe view-config:* It allows to bind meta-data (e.g. for security) to views with a type-safe, but flexible approach. It provides a more solid navigation in case of JSF and helps a lot in the maintenance phase.

*View-Controller:* Based on type-safe view-configs view-controller annotations provide a type-safe alternative to standard-tags.

*Injection on Converters and Validators:* Allows to inject CDI beans and EJB in to JSF Converters and Validators.

*JSF event broadcasting to CDI:* Allows CDI to be notified about JSF events

=== Productivity Improvements

*Security based on annotations:* The foundation for building a robust, capable and non invasive security solution.

*New CDI scopes:* TransactionScoped, WindowScoped, ViewScoped, ViewAccess scope, Grouped conversion scope

*Container Control and Test Control:* Java SE with CDI, all with a unifying API. Start, stop, add classes to a running CDI container.

*Data Module:* An out of the box entity framework solution complete with support for container or application managed persistence contexts, as well as JDBC.

*Decoupled Exception handling:* Allows to do exception handling in one location similar to CDI Observers.

*JMX integration:* Any CDI bean can be exposed via JMX easily with one annotation.

*Type-safe i18n messages:* Localized messages are easy to use with an interface and a resource bundle, no more boilerplate and your messages now have context within the code.

*Type-safe ProjectStages:* Compared to ProjectStages in JSF, DeltaSpike provides a type-safe, but still extensible approach which can be used in CDI based applications.
